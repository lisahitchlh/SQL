/*The Front Man needs to analyze and rank the teams before the Tug of War game begins. 
For each team that has exactly 10 players, calculate their average player age. 
Additionally, categorize the teams based on their average player age into three age groups:

'Fit': Average age < 40
'Grizzled': Average age between 40 and 50 (inclusive)
'Elderly': Average age > 50

Show the team_id, average age, age group, and rank the teams based on their average player age 
(highest average age = rank 1).
