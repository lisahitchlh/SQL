-- At the winter market, Cindy Lou is browsing the clothing inventory and wants to find all items with "sweater" in their name. 
-- But the challenge is the color and item columns have inconsistent capitalization. 
-- Can you write a query to return only the sweater names and their cleaned-up colors.


SELECT lower(item_name) as item_name, lower(color)
FROM winter_clothing
WHERE lower(item_name) LIKE '%sweater%'
