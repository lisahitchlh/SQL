-- During a quiet evening of reflection, Cindy Lou wants to categorize her tasks based on how peaceful they are. 
-- Can you write a query that adds a new column classifying each task as 'Calm' if its noise_level is below 50, and 'Chaotic' otherwise?


SELECT task_id
  , task_name
  , noise_level
  , CASE WHEN noise_level < 50 THEN 'Calm' ELSE "Chaotic" END AS Peace_Score
FROM evening_tasks
