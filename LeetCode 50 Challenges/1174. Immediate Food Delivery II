/*
If the customer's preferred delivery date is the same as the order date, 
then the order is called immediate; otherwise, it is called scheduled.

The first order of a customer is the order with the earliest order date that the customer made. 
It is guaranteed that a customer has precisely one first order.

Write a solution to find the percentage of immediate orders in the first orders of all customers, 
rounded to 2 decimal places.
