The confirmation rate of a user is the number of 'confirmed' messages divided by the total 
number of requested confirmation messages. The confirmation rate of a user that 
did not request any confirmation messages is 0. Round the confirmation rate to
two decimal places.
Write a solution to find the confirmation rate of each user.
