-Write a solution to find the average selling price for each product. average_price should be rounded to 2 decimal places. If a product does not have any sold units, its average selling price is assumed to be 0.

SELECT p.product_id
,  COALESCE(ROUND(SUM(p.price * NULLIF(u.units,0))/NULLIF(SUM(u.units),0),2),0) as average_price
FROM Prices as p

LEFT JOIN UnitsSold as u
    ON p.product_id = u.product_id
    AND u.purchase_date BETWEEN p.start_date and p.end_date

GROUP BY 1;
